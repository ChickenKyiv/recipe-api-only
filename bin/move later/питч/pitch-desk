GS is a shopping list toolkit that focused on meal planning functionality

Problem
Users still use paper lists when go for groceries

Impulse purchases

don't have a lot of will and meet their fitness or weight loss goals

WHY
I code more complex projects for my clients before and this projects was related to food tech category.


Who use it

Meal planning startups
Food ordering services
Nutritionists
Chefs

PROBLEM
There no easy way to create GL from mealplans

Create GL by hands or pick one of our GL templates. Ready to use collection

Dont have a unified solutions, must create from scratch, usually use not a good quality tools

or they cost a lot or something else

Пользователи обычно не планируют свои листы больше чем на одну покупку.


Use phone for store products that you must purchases
ability to order Food

Business Model

I know that i need to use shopping list
But i didn't do it

PROBLEM
have 3 items


solutions
a mobile app to save and share list of items that you or your family must purchase.


MARKET
I think it's huge

TEAM
99% of coding part i did myself. And project management was done myself
I'm working myself at this project
But if i'll see potential - i can extend my project. I plan to hire only experienced developers.
at long distance it'll save a lot of money.
They know how to create a good code.
Right now i'm building a team with interns. a lot of people want to work for experience(i.e. free) at summer 18



Angel investment round is $35k
This sum will be enough for build working project.

$3k per month - experieced developer salary
$15 per hour - for design work
$5-15 per hour for tester

I can be a sub dev that works on small things and manage our delivery progress

Purchase hosting for code and database
Purchase domain and transfer demo-website on it.
Include Drift or Intercom for product support
Some cash can go to experiments - deals, A/B testing, advertising, pr
maybe we'll use some press-release firm in roder to get attention or we can move our copyrighting stuff in-house

Actually if'll be good to have an assistant that can manage my work, course - because i can get lost for a days


WHO WILL Purchase
single people - door to door method

Startups like mine that want to save time

Recipe site owners
They use our service - we get their Users
+ Intro about our pertnership

Find a sales person that work only for comission (40%-60% that after all other fees)
