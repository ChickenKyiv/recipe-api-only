README.md

Great Loopback REST API tutorial: https://github.com/optis/loopback-rest-api

Links, that's important for me:

http://localhost:3000/explorer/#!/recipes/recipes_find

http://localhost:3000/api/recipe
http://localhost:3000/api/menu

http://localhost:3000/explorer/#!/customer/customer_login will return a token



@TODO fill Readme with other urls, that what we'll need for Free and Menu Milestone
