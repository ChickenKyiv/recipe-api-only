README.md

Great Loopback REST API tutorial: https://github.com/optis/loopback-rest-api

Note: **This repository is going through heavy development currently and should not be used in production unless you know what you are doing**

Links, that's important for me:

http://localhost:3000/explorer/#!/recipes/recipes_find

http://localhost:3000/api/recipe
http://localhost:3000/api/menu

http://localhost:3000/explorer/#!/customer/customer_login will return a token

For sending email notifications - we'll use MailGun

Our free key : key-4e236ace7f85293ec5eb2b37d6d9fa39
Free domain : sandbox31d3370622eb42a597ccb3fa1fd0adbf.mailgun.org

@TODO fill Readme with other urls, that what we'll need for Free and Menu Milestone

Note: Upload images are not supported right now. If you want to display images, you must upload them to storage, copy public url and save it on database.
Use this reference for adding such a functionality: https://github.com/optis/loopback-rest-api#storage
